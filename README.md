- 🌱 I’m currently learning [React](https://react-tetris-3000.netlify.app/) and Kotlin
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on a project that uses the MERN tech stack with large volumes of data
- 💬 Ask me about changing gears from a pastry chef at Ottlenghi to a software engineer, and how maybe they aren't so different 🍰
